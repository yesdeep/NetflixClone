Note: In free tier, to preserve the dyno hours from burning out or wasting, Heroku puts the app to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. Since, the app is restarted if it has greater than or equal to 30 minutes of inactivity, the session details are not stored. So, the app asks for login again in that case.
